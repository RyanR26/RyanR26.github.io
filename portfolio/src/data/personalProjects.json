        "summary": "<p>Karbon is my own take on what a UI framework should look like. It takes inspiration from Elm's functional approach while remaining undogmatic and pragmatic and retaining the flexibilty that JS offers.</p><p> I started builing Karbon as away to understand the virtual dom approach used in React and other popular frameworks. However, I realised that I could go much further than this and try to address some of the issues I disliked about the component approach and try to create something with more separated concerns when it come to the view, state, effects interactions and management.</p><p>The result was Karbon which, although still in optimisation progres, is a fully functional UI framework. In fact this SPA application is built with it.</p>",
